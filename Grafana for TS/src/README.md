# GRafana integration for Riak TS
## Purpose
This is a hacking area to support early activities such as gap analysis for the
use of Riak TS as a metric store with Grafana as the visualization engine.

## Considerations
### Language
NodeJS should be used as Grafana is a primarily NodeJS application and
ecosystem.
